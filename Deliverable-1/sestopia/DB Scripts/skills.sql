Best\r\n    practice for quantitative strategies is to gather target estimations that\r\n    are unbiased by the researcher’s theories, presence, and personality.\r\n    Getting an example of users who can represent the entire user population in\r\n    a factually important manner regularly requires many research participants.\r\n    Quantitative Research utilizes quantifiable information to detail realities\r\n    and reveals designs in research.

In qualitative methods, the\r\n    researcher acknowledges that he/she is somewhat a co-maker of research\r\n    results, so the outcomes are not totally objective and reproducible. The\r\n    results of qualitative research are normally not communicated numerically,\r\n    yet rather as topics or classifications that have happened during the\r\n    research. It is used to increase an understanding of fundamental reasons,\r\n    opinions, and motivations. It gives bits of knowledge into the issue or\r\n    assists with creating thoughts or theories for potential quantitative\r\n    research. Qualitative Research is additionally used to reveal patterns in\r\n    thought and opinions, and dive deeper into the issue.

To Create Designs That are Truly Relevant</b><br /><br />\r\n  <p>\r\n    User research is the best way to accomplish an understanding of the\r\n    individuals who are going to utilize your design. If you get what user\r\n    wants, you can make design that are relevant to them. But in case you don\'t\r\n    have an clear idea of your users understanding, you have no way of knowing\r\n    whether your design will be relevant. A design that isn\'t applicable to its\r\n    target users will never be a success.<br />\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <b>2.

People expect that products should\r\n    be easy to learn and easy to use. They hope to get them and get things done\r\n    with them while just considering what they would like to accomplish, not\r\n    having to think about the products themselves. If your user experience is\r\n    not good, than there is a possibility that people will move on with another\r\n    product. Except the fact that you are working in a field with no\r\n    competitors, a significant level of usability is essential in making any\r\n    product a commercial success. Also, people will cherish you for making an\r\n    extraordinary user experience. Regardless of whether you are designing\r\n    products for a highly specialized work environment where the users have no\r\n    other options, products with a significant level of usability will make work\r\n    forms quicker, more secure and more efficient.<br />\r\n  </p>\r\n  <b>3. To Understand the Return on Investment of Your UX Design</b><br /><br />\r\n  <p>\r\n    In spite of the fact that the significance of good design has widely\r\n    recognized, UX designers and researchers still fight for resources to enable\r\n    them to accomplish their work. Executives and stakeholder fails sometime to\r\n    see the value in putting resources in user research and UX design. If\r\n    resources become scant, UX is likewise regularly one of the first areas to\r\n    experience cuts; the explanation is that results are not as promptly felt as\r\n    when you save on development or similar areas. In software development we\r\n    can see the bugs immediately but in UX we don\'t experience the consequences\r\n    until the product reaches the users. In spite of the fact that we can argue\r\n    for the value of great UX, it is substantially more viable if we can show\r\n    it. This is the place studies to show the return on investment (ROI) on UX\r\n    efforts are extremely valuable. If you can show that the progressions you\r\n    made in the design created more sales, brought about a bigger number of\r\n    customers, or made work forms progressively effective, you have a lot more\r\n    stronger case for putting resources in UX. User studies to quantify the\r\n    impact of your design are mostly quantitative and can take various forms.\r\n    <br />\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <hr class=\"smSolid\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rofs\">\r\n  <h2 class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\"> Roles for Skill</a></h2>\r\n  <ul class=\"sm\">\r\n    <li>\r\n      <b>UX Researcher</b> – Study the requirements of target user and create\r\n      personas\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <b>Information Architect</b> – They ensure a positive user experience by\r\n      making the information accessible, logical and well organized.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <b>Usability analyst</b> – They focus on a very specific aspect of user\r\n      experience :Usability\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <b>UX writer</b> – They are the interaction between user experience\r\n      design, copywriting and branding.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <b>UX Designer</b> – They conduct user research, design, write ux copy,\r\n      validate/test with user and sell/present the design solution to the\r\n      business.\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr class=\"smSolid\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sm\" id=\"wrts\">\r\n  <h2 class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\">Work Related to Skill</a></h2>\r\n\r\n  <ul class=\"sm\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\r\n    <li>Brainstorming</li>\r\n    <li>Usability testing</li>\r\n    <li>Field studies</li>\r\n    <li>Analytical Evaluation</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n  <hr class=\"smSolid\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rwe\">\r\n  <h2 class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\"> Real-World Example</a></h2>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"text-center\">\r\n    <img\r\n      src=\"images/sd/UserResearchExample.png\"\r\n      style=\"height: 30%; width: 60%;\"\r\n      class=\"real img-fluid\"\r\n      alt=\"User Research Example\"\r\n    />\r\n    <br />Usability Lab\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    This is the real world scenario where the user is being monitored.

This purpose is also served by collecting external \r\n		measurement data following project delivery, namely during the beta testing or maintenance\r\n		phases of an E-Government or E-Commerce project. \r\n		So, the time to measure is determined by the requirements and the aims of the \r\n		measurement program and can vary from a project to another.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<p>\r\n			Although many measurement tools are available, using number of metrics, \r\n			there are not many tools available yet combining past projects’\r\n			measurement data with current project data to aid in decision making. \r\n			Combining metrics with decision support techniques, or methods for resolving uncertainty \r\n			will lead to the development of valuable tools, \r\n			which can aid towards higher-quality software for E-Government and ECommerce systems.\r\n			</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"roai\">\r\n		<h2 class=\"sm\"> <a href=\"#index\">Role of Academia or Industry in Cultivating the Skill</a> </h2>\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\"/>\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n			\r\n			<p>      Software processes require knowledge and tools for measuring all working activities involved. \r\n			Despite the benefits that could be gained from models for certifying software processes, cost and complexity \r\n			are factors that must be considered by software developing companies willing to adopt them.</p>\r\n<p>Knowledge and techniques for measuring software processes have been evolving in the software engineering domain. \r\nTo manage a software, company requires continuously improving staff and conditions that leverage working processes performance. \r\nIt is not seldom to find software developing companies considering process measurements as an additional and difficult activity.\r\n However, PMS have been adopted as a proactive approach by software developing companies willing to improve software quality from \r\n a viewpoint of development processes.</p> \r\n <p>The measurement process present in maturity models for software processes can function as the\r\n foundation for structuring a PMS with metrics for supporting business decisions at software developing companies. \r\n The continuous analysis of measurements acquired from different software projects and processes can provide information to \r\n support business decisions, corrective actions for projects and for promoting competitive advantage.
