INSART took charge by implementing modern technologies like Java 8, PostgreSQL 9, Spring Framework, AngularJS, etc., and created a new system architecture. \r\n			This allowed us to improve system performance, avoid multiple software faults found in the legacy system and add new functionality. As a result, the system became \r\n			scalable and easy to update.\r\n		</div>\r\n\r\n		<div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-top:30px\">\r\n			<div class=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n				<h5>Legacy architecture</h5>\r\n				<img alt=\"Legacy architecture\" src=\"images/sm/legacy.jpg\" style=\"width:500px;\" class=\"responsive\">\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n				<h5>New architecture</h5>\r\n				<img alt=\"New architecture\" src=\"images/sm/new.jpg\" style=\"width:500px;\" class=\"responsive\">\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-top:30px\">\r\n	\r\n				Reengineering has been ongoing for two years and the revamped Online Marketing Platform is still being developed and improved. \r\n				Nevertheless, it has already met almost all requirements for functionality, performance, scalability and reliability.\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n\r\n		<h5 style=\"margin-top:60px\">3. The Remote Device Management Project</h5>\r\n		<div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-top:30px\">\r\n			\r\n			<p>\r\n			Having worked with the Remote Device Management project for several years, the INSART team suggested a strategy of reengineering the system to the customer which \r\n			would solve the performance and scalability problems caused by monolithic core architecture and using inconvenient database structure. The customer agreed with the \r\n			presented arguments and as a result, the INSART team supports operability of the current system version and is simultaneously developing a new system.\r\n			</p>\r\n\r\n			<p>\r\n			Using new technologies (Spring Framework 4, MongoDB, AngularJS and Bootstrap) and creating new system architecture not only increased the performance of the system, but also reduced the terms of development. Additionally, using the modified data structure allows to significantly simplify data processing and to prevent damaging data as a result of inconsistencies in user actions (this problem occurred in the legacy system).\r\n			</p>\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n\r\n\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"roai\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"> <a href=\"#index\">Role of Academia or Industry in Cultivating the Skill</a> </h2>\r\n		<hr style=\"solid 5px #bbb\"></hr>\r\n		\r\n		<div class=\"row\" style=\"width:70%	\">\r\n			Software engineering curricula emphasize developing new software systems.

Best practice for quantitative strategies is to gather target estimations that are unbiased by the researcher’s theories, presence, and personality. Getting an example of users who can represent the entire user population in a factually important manner regularly requires many research participants. Quantitative Research utilizes quantifiable information to detail realities and reveals designs in research. Quantitative data collection techniques are considerably more organized than Qualitative data collection methods.<br><br>\r\n<b>B) Qualitative research</b><br>\r\nQualitative techniques, for example, interviews, case studies, observation, group discussion, open-ended questionnaires, and (somewhat) ease of use tests are frequently more exploratory and look to get a more inside and out comprehension of the individual users’ or user group’s experiences, motivations, and regular daily existences. In qualitative methods, the researcher acknowledges that he/she is somewhat a co-maker of research results, so the outcomes are not totally objective and reproducible. The results of qualitative research are normally not communicated numerically, yet rather as topics or classifications that have happened during the research. It is used to increase an understanding of fundamental reasons, opinions, and motivations. It gives bits of knowledge into the issue or assists with creating thoughts or theories for potential quantitative research. Qualitative Research is additionally used to reveal patterns in thought and opinions, and dive deeper into the issue. It gives detailed information including knowledge about behavior, attitude, and aptitude of the user.<br>\r\n\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"pfs\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\"> Prerequisites for Skill</a> </h2>\r\n				\r\n		<ul class=\"sm\" style=\"width:70%\">\r\n		<li>Experience conducting user research</li>\r\n		<li>Experience with qualitative and user-centered design methodologies</li>\r\n		<li>Working knowledge of quantitative, behavioral analysis and statistics</li>\r\n		<li>Surveys and formal experiments</li>\r\n		<li>Critical-thinking and problem-solving skills</li>\r\n		</ul> \r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rsfea\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"> <a href=\"#index\">Related Software Engineering Area(s) </a> </h2>\r\n		<ul class=\"sm\" style=\"width:50%\">\r\n		<li>Software Requirements</li>\r\n		<li>Software Quality</li>\r\n		<li>Software Engineering Professional Practice</li>\r\n		</ul> \r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rafs\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"> <a href=\"#index\">Rationale for Skill</a> </h2>\r\n		<div class=\"box\">\"Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a pointless task.\"<br>\r\n		<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Tim Brown, CEO of the innovation and design firm IDEO</i></div>\r\n		<b>1. To Create Designs That are Truly Relevant</b><br><br>\r\nUser research is the best way to accomplish an understanding of the individuals who are going to utilize your design. If you get what user wants, you can make design that are relevant to them. But in case you don\'t have an clear idea of your users understanding, you have no way of knowing whether your design will be relevant. A design that isn\'t applicable to its target users will never be a success.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>2. To Create Designs That are Easy and Pleasurable to Use</b><br>\r\n<div class=\"box\">\"If the user is having a problem, it’s our problem.”<br>\r\n<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computers</i></div><br>\r\nProducts should have a significant level of usability and user tests can be a major assistance in accomplishing that. People expect that products should be easy to learn and easy to use. They hope to get them and get things done with them while just considering what they would like to accomplish, not having to think about the products themselves. If your user experience is not good, than there is a possibility that people will move on with another product. Except the fact that you are working in a field with no competitors, a significant level of usability is essential in making any product a commercial success. Also, people will cherish you for making an extraordinary user experience. Regardless of whether you are designing products for a highly specialized work environment where the users have no other options, products with a significant level of usability will make work forms quicker, more secure and more efficient.<br><br>\r\n<b>3. To Understand the Return on Investment of Your UX Design</b></br><br>\r\nIn spite of the fact that the significance of good design has widely recognized, UX designers and researchers still fight for resources to enable them to accomplish their work. Executives and stakeholder fails sometime to see the value in putting resources in user research and UX design. If resources become scant, UX is likewise regularly one of the first areas to experience cuts; the explanation is that results are not as promptly felt as when you save on development or similar areas. In software development we can see the bugs immediately but in UX we don\'t experience the consequences until the product reaches the users. In spite of the fact that we can argue for the value of great UX, it is substantially more viable if we can show it. This is the place studies to show the return on investment (ROI) on UX efforts are extremely valuable. If you can show that the progressions you made in the design created more sales, brought about a bigger number of customers, or made work forms progressively effective, you have a lot more stronger case for putting resources in UX. User studies to quantify the impact of your design are mostly quantitative and can take various forms. <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rofs\">\r\n	<h2  class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\"> Roles for Skill</a> </h2>\r\n	<ul class=\"sm\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n		<li><b>UX Researcher</b> – Study the requirements of target user and create personas</li>\r\n		<li><b>Information Architect</b> – They ensure a positive user experience by making the information accessible, logical and well organized.</li>\r\n		<li><b>Usability analyst</b> – They focus on a very specific aspect of user experience :Usability</li>\r\n		<li><b>UX writer</b> – They are the interaction between user experience design, copywriting and branding.</li>\r\n		<li><b>UX Designer</b> – They conduct user research, design, write ux copy, validate/test with user and sell/present the design solution to the business.</li>\r\n		</ul> \r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"wrts\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"> <a href=\"#index\">Work Related to Skill </a></h2>\r\n\r\n		<ul class=\"sm\" style=\"width:50%\">\r\n		<li>Brainstorming</li>\r\n		<li>Usability testing</li>\r\n		<li>Field studies</li>\r\n		<li>Analytical Evaluation</li>\r\n		</ul> \r\n\r\n		<hr class=\"smSolid\" ></hr>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"sm\" id=\"rwe\">\r\n		<h2  class=\"sm\"><a href=\"#index\"> Real-World Example</a> </h2>\r\n\r\n		<center><img class=\"real\" src=\"images/sd/UserResearchExample.png\" style=\"height:30%; width:60%\" class=\"responsive\">\r\n		<figcaption>Usability Lab</figcaption></center>\r\n		This is the real world scenario where the user is being monitored.
